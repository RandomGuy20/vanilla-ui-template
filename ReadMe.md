# American Sound Vanilla JS Template

# This is a Vanilla template that will automatically set up the following
## 1. Your dist folder
## 2. Your Public folder
## 3. Give basic folder structure for internal projects
## 4. Will install all needed dependencies to create a Vanilla project for Crestron Control Systems.
## 5. This Has your basic initial scripts, feel free to ONLY EDIT the scripts and nothing else in package.json, until you are more familiar with vite and Vue.



### This will be further updated as more of the team switches to Vanilla from Construct and as client needs dictate our initial setup.
